# Quick Start Guide
> EZChat is a **self-hosted**, **self-maintained** application. I can not monitor your actions with it, and you are responsible for your actions using EZchat.

EZchat is standalone and has no dependencies. You do not need to download anything to host an EZchat server.
EZchat uses minimal resources and a minimal web server(Kestrel), so you do not need to worry about your specs or resources.
EZChat can be hosted on Linux, Linux-ARM, or Windows. Depending on your OS, follow either tutorial to start your EZchat server.

> Some OSs may not be supported by the release builds.  *Advanced: You can rebuild the binaries to the OS or kernel you want using the RID modifier.*
