<p>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>
<p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.</p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</p>
<p>of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Preamble</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for</p>
<p>software and other kinds of works.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed</p>
<p>to take away your freedom to share and change the works. &nbsp;By contrast,</p>
<p>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to</p>
<p>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free</p>
<p>software for all its users. &nbsp;We, the Free Software Foundation, use the</p>
<p>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to</p>
<p>any other work released this way by its authors. &nbsp;You can apply it to</p>
<p>your programs, too.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</p>
<p>price. &nbsp;Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</p>
<p>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</p>
<p>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you</p>
<p>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new</p>
<p>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you</p>
<p>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. &nbsp;Therefore, you have</p>
<p>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if</p>
<p>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</p>
<p>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same</p>
<p>freedoms that you received. &nbsp;You must make sure that they, too, receive</p>
<p>or can get the source code. &nbsp;And you must show them these terms so they</p>
<p>know their rights.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:</p>
<p>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License</p>
<p>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>For the developers&apos; and authors&apos; protection, the GPL clearly explains</p>
<p>that there is no warranty for this free software. &nbsp;For both users&apos; and</p>
<p>authors&apos; sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as</p>
<p>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to</p>
<p>authors of previous versions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run</p>
<p>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer</p>
<p>can do so. &nbsp;This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of</p>
<p>protecting users&apos; freedom to change the software. &nbsp;The systematic</p>
<p>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to</p>
<p>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. &nbsp;Therefore, we</p>
<p>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those</p>
<p>products. &nbsp;If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we</p>
<p>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions</p>
<p>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.</p>
<p>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of</p>
<p>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to</p>
<p>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could</p>
<p>make it effectively proprietary. &nbsp;To prevent this, the GPL assures that</p>
<p>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</p>
<p>modification follow.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>0. Definitions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of</p>
<p>works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this</p>
<p>License. &nbsp;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. &nbsp;&quot;Licensees&quot; and</p>
<p>&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work</p>
<p>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an</p>
<p>exact copy. &nbsp;The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the</p>
<p>earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based</p>
<p>on the Program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without</p>
<p>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for</p>
<p>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a</p>
<p>computer or modifying a private copy. &nbsp;Propagation includes copying,</p>
<p>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the</p>
<p>public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other</p>
<p>parties to make or receive copies. &nbsp;Mere interaction with a user through</p>
<p>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;</p>
<p>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible</p>
<p>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)</p>
<p>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the</p>
<p>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the</p>
<p>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. &nbsp;If</p>
<p>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a</p>
<p>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1. Source Code.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work</p>
<p>for making modifications to it. &nbsp;&quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source</p>
<p>form of a work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official</p>
<p>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of</p>
<p>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that</p>
<p>is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other</p>
<p>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of</p>
<p>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major</p>
<p>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that</p>
<p>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an</p>
<p>implementation is available to the public in source code form. &nbsp;A</p>
<p>&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component</p>
<p>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system</p>
<p>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to</p>
<p>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all</p>
<p>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable</p>
<p>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to</p>
<p>control those activities. &nbsp;However, it does not include the work&apos;s</p>
<p>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free</p>
<p>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but</p>
<p>which are not part of the work. &nbsp;For example, Corresponding Source</p>
<p>includes interface definition files associated with source files for</p>
<p>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically</p>
<p>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,</p>
<p>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those</p>
<p>subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users</p>
<p>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding</p>
<p>Source.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that</p>
<p>same work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2. Basic Permissions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of</p>
<p>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated</p>
<p>conditions are met. &nbsp;This License explicitly affirms your unlimited</p>
<p>permission to run the unmodified Program. &nbsp;The output from running a</p>
<p>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its</p>
<p>content, constitutes a covered work. &nbsp;This License acknowledges your</p>
<p>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not</p>
<p>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains</p>
<p>in force. &nbsp;You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose</p>
<p>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you</p>
<p>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with</p>
<p>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do</p>
<p>not control copyright. &nbsp;Those thus making or running the covered works</p>
<p>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction</p>
<p>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of</p>
<p>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under</p>
<p>the conditions stated below. &nbsp;Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10</p>
<p>makes it unnecessary.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>3. Protecting Users&apos; Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological</p>
<p>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article</p>
<p>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or</p>
<p>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such</p>
<p>measures.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid</p>
<p>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention</p>
<p>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to</p>
<p>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or</p>
<p>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work&apos;s</p>
<p>users, your or third parties&apos; legal rights to forbid circumvention of</p>
<p>technological measures.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s source code as you</p>
<p>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and</p>
<p>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;</p>
<p>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any</p>
<p>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;</p>
<p>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all</p>
<p>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,</p>
<p>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to</p>
<p>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the</p>
<p>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified</p>
<p>it, and giving a relevant date.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is</p>
<p>released under this License and any conditions added under section</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to</p>
<p>&quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this</p>
<p>License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. &nbsp;This</p>
<p>License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7</p>
<p>additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,</p>
<p>regardless of how they are packaged. &nbsp;This License gives no</p>
<p>permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not</p>
<p>invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display</p>
<p>Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive</p>
<p>interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your</p>
<p>work need not make them do so.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent</p>
<p>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,</p>
<p>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,</p>
<p>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an</p>
<p>&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not</p>
<p>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation&apos;s users</p>
<p>beyond what the individual works permit. &nbsp;Inclusion of a covered work</p>
<p>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other</p>
<p>parts of the aggregate.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms</p>
<p>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the</p>
<p>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,</p>
<p>in one of these ways:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p>
<p>(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the</p>
<p>Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium</p>
<p>customarily used for software interchange.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product</p>
<p>(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a</p>
<p>written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as</p>
<p>long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product</p>
<p>model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a</p>
<p>copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the</p>
<p>product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical</p>
<p>medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no</p>
<p>more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this</p>
<p>conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the</p>
<p>Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the</p>
<p>written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. &nbsp;This</p>
<p>alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and</p>
<p>only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord</p>
<p>with subsection 6b.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated</p>
<p>place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the</p>
<p>Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no</p>
<p>further charge. &nbsp;You need not require recipients to copy the</p>
<p>Corresponding Source along with the object code. &nbsp;If the place to</p>
<p>copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source</p>
<p>may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)</p>
<p>that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain</p>
<p>clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the</p>
<p>Corresponding Source. &nbsp;Regardless of what server hosts the</p>
<p>Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is</p>
<p>available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided</p>
<p>you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding</p>
<p>Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no</p>
<p>charge under subsection 6d.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded</p>
<p>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be</p>
<p>included in conveying the object code work.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any</p>
<p>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,</p>
<p>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation</p>
<p>into a dwelling. &nbsp;In determining whether a product is a consumer product,</p>
<p>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. &nbsp;For a particular</p>
<p>product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a</p>
<p>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status</p>
<p>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user</p>
<p>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. &nbsp;A product</p>
<p>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial</p>
<p>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent</p>
<p>the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,</p>
<p>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install</p>
<p>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from</p>
<p>a modified version of its Corresponding Source. &nbsp;The information must</p>
<p>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object</p>
<p>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because</p>
<p>modification has been made.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or</p>
<p>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as</p>
<p>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the</p>
<p>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a</p>
<p>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied</p>
<p>by the Installation Information. &nbsp;But this requirement does not apply</p>
<p>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install</p>
<p>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has</p>
<p>been installed in ROM).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a</p>
<p>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates</p>
<p>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for</p>
<p>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. &nbsp;Access to a</p>
<p>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and</p>
<p>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and</p>
<p>protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,</p>
<p>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly</p>
<p>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in</p>
<p>source code form), and must require no special password or key for</p>
<p>unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>7. Additional Terms.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>&quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this</p>
<p>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.</p>
<p>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall</p>
<p>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent</p>
<p>that they are valid under applicable law. &nbsp;If additional permissions</p>
<p>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately</p>
<p>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by</p>
<p>this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option</p>
<p>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of</p>
<p>it. &nbsp;(Additional permissions may be written to require their own</p>
<p>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) &nbsp;You may place</p>
<p>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,</p>
<p>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you</p>
<p>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of</p>
<p>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the</p>
<p>terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or</p>
<p>author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal</p>
<p>Notices displayed by works containing it; or</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or</p>
<p>requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in</p>
<p>reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or</p>
<p>authors of the material; or</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some</p>
<p>trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that</p>
<p>material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of</p>
<p>it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for</p>
<p>any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on</p>
<p>those licensors and authors.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further</p>
<p>restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10. &nbsp;If the Program as you</p>
<p>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is</p>
<p>governed by this License along with a term that is a further</p>
<p>restriction, you may remove that term. &nbsp;If a license document contains</p>
<p>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this</p>
<p>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms</p>
<p>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does</p>
<p>not survive such relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you</p>
<p>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the</p>
<p>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating</p>
<p>where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the</p>
<p>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;</p>
<p>the above requirements apply either way.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>8. Termination.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly</p>
<p>provided under this License. &nbsp;Any attempt otherwise to propagate or</p>
<p>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under</p>
<p>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third</p>
<p>paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your</p>
<p>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)</p>
<p>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and</p>
<p>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright</p>
<p>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means</p>
<p>prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</p>
<p>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</p>
<p>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</p>
<p>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</p>
<p>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</p>
<p>your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</p>
<p>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</p>
<p>this License. &nbsp;If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</p>
<p>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same</p>
<p>material under section 10.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or</p>
<p>run a copy of the Program. &nbsp;Ancillary propagation of a covered work</p>
<p>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission</p>
<p>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. &nbsp;However,</p>
<p>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or</p>
<p>modify any covered work. &nbsp;These actions infringe copyright if you do</p>
<p>not accept this License. &nbsp;Therefore, by modifying or propagating a</p>
<p>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically</p>
<p>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and</p>
<p>propagate that work, subject to this License. &nbsp;You are not responsible</p>
<p>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an</p>
<p>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an</p>
<p>organization, or merging organizations. &nbsp;If propagation of a covered</p>
<p>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that</p>
<p>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever</p>
<p>licenses to the work the party&apos;s predecessor in interest had or could</p>
<p>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the</p>
<p>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if</p>
<p>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the</p>
<p>rights granted or affirmed under this License. &nbsp;For example, you may</p>
<p>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of</p>
<p>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation</p>
<p>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that</p>
<p>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for</p>
<p>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>11. Patents.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this</p>
<p>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. &nbsp;The</p>
<p>work thus licensed is called the contributor&apos;s &quot;contributor version&quot;.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A contributor&apos;s &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims</p>
<p>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or</p>
<p>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted</p>
<p>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,</p>
<p>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a</p>
<p>consequence of further modification of the contributor version. &nbsp;For</p>
<p>purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant</p>
<p>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of</p>
<p>this License.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free</p>
<p>patent license under the contributor&apos;s essential patent claims, to</p>
<p>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and</p>
<p>propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express</p>
<p>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent</p>
<p>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to</p>
<p>sue for patent infringement). &nbsp;To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a</p>
<p>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a</p>
<p>patent against the party.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,</p>
<p>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone</p>
<p>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a</p>
<p>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,</p>
<p>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so</p>
<p>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the</p>
<p>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner</p>
<p>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent</p>
<p>license to downstream recipients. &nbsp;&quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have</p>
<p>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the</p>
<p>covered work in a country, or your recipient&apos;s use of the covered work</p>
<p>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that</p>
<p>country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or</p>
<p>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a</p>
<p>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties</p>
<p>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify</p>
<p>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license</p>
<p>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered</p>
<p>work and works based on it.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within</p>
<p>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is</p>
<p>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are</p>
<p>specifically granted under this License. &nbsp;You may not convey a covered</p>
<p>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is</p>
<p>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment</p>
<p>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying</p>
<p>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the</p>
<p>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory</p>
<p>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work</p>
<p>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily</p>
<p>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that</p>
<p>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,</p>
<p>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting</p>
<p>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may</p>
<p>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>12. No Surrender of Others&apos; Freedom.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</p>
<p>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</p>
<p>excuse you from the conditions of this License. &nbsp;If you cannot convey a</p>
<p>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</p>
<p>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may</p>
<p>not convey it at all. &nbsp;For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you</p>
<p>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey</p>
<p>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this</p>
<p>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have</p>
<p>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed</p>
<p>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single</p>
<p>combined work, and to convey the resulting work. &nbsp;The terms of this</p>
<p>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,</p>
<p>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,</p>
<p>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the</p>
<p>combination as such.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>14. Revised Versions of this License.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of</p>
<p>the GNU General Public License from time to time. &nbsp;Such new versions will</p>
<p>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</p>
<p>address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. &nbsp;If the</p>
<p>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General</p>
<p>Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the</p>
<p>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered</p>
<p>version or of any later version published by the Free Software</p>
<p>Foundation. &nbsp;If the Program does not specify a version number of the</p>
<p>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published</p>
<p>by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future</p>
<p>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy&apos;s</p>
<p>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you</p>
<p>to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different</p>
<p>permissions. &nbsp;However, no additional obligations are imposed on any</p>
<p>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a</p>
<p>later version.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY</p>
<p>APPLICABLE LAW. &nbsp;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT</p>
<p>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY</p>
<p>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,</p>
<p>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR</p>
<p>PURPOSE. &nbsp;THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM</p>
<p>IS WITH YOU. &nbsp;SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF</p>
<p>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>16. Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</p>
<p>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS</p>
<p>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY</p>
<p>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE</p>
<p>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF</p>
<p>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD</p>
<p>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),</p>
<p>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF</p>
<p>SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided</p>
<p>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,</p>
<p>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates</p>
<p>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the</p>
<p>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a</p>
<p>copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
<p><br></p>
